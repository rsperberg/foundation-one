# Foundation One

Based on the central font design used in Foundation, the Apple TV+ series based on the Asimov books, to indicate a change in context, location or time.  Released with the Open Font License (OFL).

<img src="samples/Foundation_One_name.png" alt="The name Foundation One is shown in large type on an image showing spaceships attacking a planet, a scene from the Apple TV+ series Foundation â€” underneath that is a tagline, 'The premier font used across the galaxy'" title="Foundation One, the premier font used across the galaxy">

The font is still under construction and not all the characters and numbers (and hardly any symbols or punctuation) have shown up.  Here the "missing" glyphs are substituted with  &#8220;compatible conjectures&#8221;:

<img src="samples/Foundation_One_glyphs.png" alt="All uppercase letters, numbers, punctuation and most Basic Latin symbols of the Foundation One font, displayed against a scene from the Apple TV+ series Foundation, based on the Asimov books" title="Foundation One charset, fleshed out to the Basic Latin codeblock">

As you can see, the font features distinctive S, M, U, W, B, K and G shapes not shared with other typefaces.  Many characters and all the numbers include dots in the design (H, 1, 3) or as a decorative element (A, S, W).
