# Foundation One

The font design used in Foundation, the Apple TV+ series, to indicate a change in location or time. Released with the Open Font License (OFL).

The font is still under construction and not all the characters and numbers (and hardly any symbols or punctuation) have shown up. Here is everything so far (in black), filled in with &#8220;compatible conjectures&#8221; (in gray) for what&rsquo;s missing:

<img src="samples/Foundation_One_conjectured_characters.png" alt="The text 'Quizzical twins proved my hijack bugfix' plus numbers, basic symbols and punctuation, set in the Foundation One font, based on the Apple TV+ series Foundation" title="Characters already completed in the Foundation One font" />
